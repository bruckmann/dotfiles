# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty it self.
# env:
# TERM env customization.
#
# If this property is not set, alacritty will set it to xterm-256color.
#
# Note that some xterm terminfo databases don't declare support for italics.
# You can verify this by checking for the presence of `smso` and `sitm` in
# `infocmp xterm-256color`.
# TERM: xterm-256color-italic
window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)
  #
  # Specified in number of columns/lines, not pixels. If both are zero this
  # setting is ignored.
  dimensions:
    columns: 100
    lines: 85

  # Window padding (changes require restart)
  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is not scaled by
  # DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.
  padding:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Spread additional padding evenly around the terminal content.
  dynamic_padding: false

  # Window decorations
  #
  # Available values:
  # - full: borders and title bar
  # - none: neither borders nor title bar
  # - transparent: title bar, transparent background and title bar buttons
  # - buttonless: title bar, transparent background, but no title bar buttons
  decorations: buttonless

  # Startup Mode (changes require restart)
  #
  # Values for `startup_mode`:
  #   - Windowed
  #   - Maximized
  #   - Fullscreen
  #
  # Values for `startup_mode` (macOS only):
  #   - SimpleFullscreen
  startup_mode: Windowed

  # Background opacity
  opacity: 1.0

scrolling:
  # maximum number of lines in the scrollback buffer. Specifying '0' will
  # disable scrolling.
  history: 0

  # Number of lines the viewport will move for every line scrolled when
  # scrollback is enabled (history > 0).
  multiplier: 3

# Font configuration (changes require restart)
font:
  # The normal (roman) font face to use.
  # Style can be specified to pick a specific face.
  normal:
    family: FiraCode Nerd Font 
    style: Retina
      # The bold font face
  bold:
    family: FiraCode Nerd Font
    style: Bold
      # The italic font face
  italic:
    family: FiraCode Nerd Font
    style: "Light Italic"
  
    # Point size of the font
  size: 14.0

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. offset.y can be thought of
  # as modifying the linespacing, and offset.x as modifying the letter spacing.
  offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increase the x offset to move the glyph to
  # the right, increase the y offset to move the glyph upward.
  glyph_offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)
  #
  # Thin strokes are suitable for retina displays, but for non-retina you
  # probably want this set to false.
  #
  # macOS >= 10.14.x:
  #
  # If the font quality on non-retina display looks bad then set
  # `use_thin_strokes` to `true` and enable font smoothing by running the
  # following command:
  #   `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`
  #
  # This is a global setting and will require a log out or restart to take
  # effect.
  use_thin_strokes: true

# When true, bold text is drawn using the bright variant of colors.
draw_bold_text_with_bright_colors: false

# Use custom cursor colors. If true, display the cursor in the cursor.foreground
# and cursor.background colors, otherwise invert the colors of the cursor.
custom_cursor_colors: true

# Visual Bell
#
# Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once
# rung, the terminal background will be set to white and transition back to the
# default background color. You can control the rate of this transition by
# setting the `duration` property (represented in milliseconds). You can also
# configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.
#
# Possible values for `animation`
# `Ease`
# `EaseOut`
# `EaseOutSine`
# `EaseOutQuad`
# `EaseOutCubic`
# `EaseOutQuart`
# `EaseOutQuint`
# `EaseOutExpo`
# `EaseOutCirc`
# `Linear`
#
# To completely disable the visual bell, set its duration to 0.
